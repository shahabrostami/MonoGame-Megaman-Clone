# monogame-testing

I'm spending 30 minutes or so now and then just adding some random code for a simple platformer.

I've not done too much game development, but rather than spend hours looking at instructions online 
I'm just going to dive in and try to design the code without any guides/tutorials etc. 

I'm probably going to come up with some weird designs but hopefully I can then go back and 
look at these tutorials and compare the approach used between my code and theirs - should be interesting!
